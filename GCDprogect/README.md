Course Project:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset cleaning and
gathering
==================================================================

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- mean values of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration for each subjects in
one kind of activity.
- mean value of standard deviation of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration for each subjects in one kind of activity.

- mean values of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope for each subjects in one kind of activity.
- mean value of andard deviation of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope for each subjects in one kind of activity.

- mean value of A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables for each subjects in one kind of activity for each subjects in one kind of activity.
- mean value of standard deviation of A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables for each subjects in one kind of activity for each subjects in one kind of activity.

- Its activity with decriptive category variables. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md: gives detailed experimental design process, data source, and the explaination of measurenments variables and what kind of transformation has done.
3. summarisedData.txt: The otput tidy data
4. run_analysis.R: the original R code with which author performed those transformation
