Experimental design and background:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

Transformations:
1. read in all original data set
2. merge data in original train folder
3. merge data in original test folder
4. merge processed test and train data
5. make a valid name vector and aasign names to merged data.
6. select measurements only containing "std" or"mean"
7. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
8. summarise tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Processed data:
 Assignment was converted to a summarized data in txt file. Only remaining measurements that represent mean value and standard deviation, the data shows mean value of each measurements grouped by tested person and kinds of activities. The measurment variables begin at the third column till the end.The first value"Subjects" represents different tested people in experiments labeled from 1 to 30 and the second variable "ActivityLabels" means corresponding activities when the data was being collected. The name of each measurements is consisted of 3 ingredients: device name, mathmatical meanning(mean,standard deviation or mean frequency) and at which axises in 3 dimention(if any). The following are detailed variable names.
